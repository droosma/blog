## Hello

Welcome to my blog. I'm Duncan, a software engineer from Netherlands. I've been working in the industry sins 2008, and I've decided to start sharing my thoughts and opinions on the industry, and the world in general.

A thing I have been wanting to do ever sins I started working in the industry, but I never felt comfortable enough to do so. Having been diagnosed with dyslexia at a young age, I have always been very self-conscious about my writing. I have always been afraid that people would judge me for my spelling and grammar mistakes, and I would be ridiculed for it. With the introduction of the GPT Language Model, I'm finally able to start sharing my thoughts and opinions online without feeling to ask my wife to spellcheck every single article I write, she loves to do it, but as she is not in the industry, we have mixed results.

I have a wide range of interest and opinions on a lot of different topics, and I'm looking forward to sharing them with you.

Given that I'm a big proponent of honesty and transparency, I will be publishing the raw blogs posts, pre GPT-4 processing, on my GitHub. This way you can see the original text, and the changes that GPT-4 made to it.

Look for the link in the footer of each article, I'm still trying to figure out a way to dynamically generate a link to the markdown file on GitHub, but until that time I will manually put it there.
