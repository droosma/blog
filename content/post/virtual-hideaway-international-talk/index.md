On February 1, 2024, I had the honor of speaking at the [Cloud Technology Townhall Tallinn 2024 (CTTT2024)](https://cloudtechtallinn.com/2024-schedule/). This marked my first international presentation, and I'm eager to share the path that led me there. I write this reflection for myselfâ€”to catalog the journey and the lessons it bestowed upon me. Yet, I also hope it serves to inspire others to step forward and share their insights with the world.

In this article, I'll frequently mention [Matthijs van der Veer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthijsvanderveer). His guidance was instrumental throughout this journey, and I am deeply appreciative of his support. Should you encounter Matthijs at a conference, I wholeheartedly recommend attending his session. He's not only an exceptional speaker but also a wealth of knowledge.

## The road to Tallinn

In consulting, moments often arise when you find yourself between assignments. During these periods, my employer encourages us to use the time to enhance our professional authority. In mid-2023, as the influence and potential of Generative AI (GenAI) for our clients became increasingly evident, I was encouraged to delve into this topic, especially given its rising interest among our customers. One area that stood out was Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), particularly relevant since GPT-3.5 was limited to only 4k tokens at the time, making RAG a promising technique for short-term applications. Eager to understand the technology firsthand, a colleague and I, both awaiting new projects, began our exploration. Our journey into research and experimentation helped us gain a deeper understanding. Upon sharing my insights with my manager, the inevitable question I had anticipated was posed: "When are you doing an XKE on this?" XKE, or [Xebia Knowledge Exchange](https://xke.xebia.com/faq/), is our biweekly internal "conference" where we explore topics of personal interest with our peers.

This was the moment when, despite my usual tendency to avoid such situations, I realized evasion might not be an option this time. Resigned to facing the challenge head-on, I decided to stop dodging and take the leap. Fortunately, the colleague with whom I had been exploring this topic had no reservations about presenting. In a way, I convinced myself that I could somewhat 'hide' behind his confidence. During our research, the subject captivated me deeply, and, being the technophile that I am, I plunged into the technicalities. This focus led to a less-than-ideal collaboration, as our attention diverged. The consequence was a presentation split into two distinct parts: one detailing the proof of concept (PoC) we developed during our investigation, and the other more focused on the technical learnings and specifics of the PoC, with me delving deeper into the latter. Given our audience comprised entirely of tech enthusiasts, I ended up leading and addressing questions for the majority of the session. This was a significant step outside my comfort zone, but I was ultimately pleased with the outcome and received positive feedback.

Fast forward a few weeks, and Microsoft unveiled the [Microsoft Learn AI Skills Challenge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/events/learn-events/ai-cloudskills-challenge/), inviting partners to host meetups centered on Azure AI. Remembering my presentation, my colleagues volunteered me to lead a session on the topic. This being a public event, my nerves were more frayed than usual. However, my remarkable colleague Matthijs, seasoned in public speaking, offered his support. We opted for a two-part session: Matthijs would cover SaaS offerings, while I would tackle the DIY solutions. The tight schedule for the event, surprisingly, worked in my favor by limiting the time I spent dwelling on my anxiety. On the day of the event, though, I was a bundle of nerves, requiring a few moments to compose myself before starting. However, as I progressed past the initial slides, I shifted into a mode of explaining to peers, an approach I usually find enjoyable. This experience was a monumental step for me, demonstrating my ability to handle public speaking despite my reservations and self-doubt. Though I did not relish the process and berated myself for letting myself get volunteered, the positive feedback and engaging discussions with attendees afterwards made it all worthwhile.

Following the success of our session and driven by Matthijs's personal goal to increase his speaking engagements, he began submitting our presentation to various conferences through Requests for Papers (RFPs). He asked if I was interested in joining him. Despite the vivid memory of my previous anxiety, I adopted a "why not" attitude, somewhat burying my head in the sand, not fully processing the implications. Surprisingly, our proposal was accepted, and we were off to Tallinn. The realization hit me like a ton of bricks, triggering a familiar wave of panic that would visit me repeatedly in the weeks leading up to the conference. Unlike the Azure AI Summer Jam, this event was two months away, affording me plenty of time to oscillate between anxiety and dread.

In the run-up to the conference, we were asked to create a promotional videoâ€”a task I had never faced before and, akin to presenting, was not particularly excited about. However, I was fortunate to have Matthijs by my side, who not only had ample experience with such endeavors but also the patience to guide me through the process. The end result was a video that received a lot of positive feedback, although personally, I found the experience rather daunting. Despite my reservations, others seemed to appreciate it. If you're curious, you can watch the video [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cloud-technology-townhall-tallinn-2024_tallinntv-cttt24-llm-activity-7138203546910470147-MAXo) and, of course, I welcome your feedback with a wink ðŸ˜‰.

The ironic part of that promotional video is that we claimed to have completed our presentation, which, in reality, was far from the truth. At that point, all we had was the original talk from the Azure AI Summer Jam. Both of us wanted to elevate the presentation, but faced with the looming stress of the upcoming event, I reverted to my "head in the sand" approach. We procrastinated, letting the deadline creep dangerously close. As December approached and I planned to take my usual break between Christmas and New Year's, I added a few extra weeks off, intending to dedicate the last week of my vacation to the presentation. However, an unexpected health issueâ€”a kidney stoneâ€”left me couch-bound, clear-minded enough to work on the presentation but physically unable to do so.



Before the vacation we had a short session about how we wanted to change the presentation, but we never synced up on it. So when I dragged myself behind my computer in the last week of my vacation, fueled by sheer terror and pain medication I didn't do what I needed to do, I needed to foster the gut wrenching feeling of no control. We wanted to change the presentation and do it differently, but we never really discussed how we wanted to change it, what we wanted to change. How the outline of the new version is now going to look. Instead I started doing what I'm comfortable with, my safe place. I started building a demo application. But as you might be telling your self now, a demo of what, you don't know what you are going to say, we'll I just used my interpretation of the short session we had, and I just went for it. That went about as well as you expected. I build something that did not match up to what we where going to say. The time I actually kicked my but in gear and work on the problem. I did the wrong thing. When we finally sat together again to hammer out what we actually wanted to do we had one week left. And I was not in a good state of mind the stress was getting so high, sleep, concentration and focus where all but gone. But after this meeting the outline became clear, I started to adjust my demo, thankfully I could recover some of the work I did on the demo and I was finally able to focus on what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it. The stress subsided when the feeling of control returned. Unfortunately, I was not out of the woods yet, as the outline of the talk became more clear, I had to start measuring the timings and start practicing. And there I learned another new aspect of me, I feel really uncomfortable when I have to talk to myself. every time I missed a line, I would start over, I would freeze up, I would get angry at myself, which makes me freeze up more. This cycle continued for a few days but I persevered, and I did notice some improvement. Another thing that I struggle with a lot, something that's called [Imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) also showed its ugly face. I was convinced that the talk was too simple, that it was not enough. The stuff I was going to talk about was not new. Are they going to be board? Am I going to waste their time? There was no time left to change the content, so I just had to surrender to the fact that this is what we where going to do.

While I was sick Xebia decided to organize another version of the Azure AI Summer Jam, the [Azure AI Winter Jam](https://events.xebia.com/azure-ai-winter-jam-2024). Given this was in the same week as CTTT2024, we decided to use it as a trial run for our presentation. Moving the deadline up 2 days. Great. While the Winter Jam setup was identical to the Summer edition, somehow in my head I had made the fact that we where going to do this presentation abroad weigh heavily on this session too. To top it off, as expected for a trial run, we had some technical issues. My computer decided to act strange when switching from PowerPoint to visual studio and back, and I had used a presenter mode for visual studio, one that allows you to change settings like light and dark mode without effecting your normal profile. But that mode acts like a new installation, and chose a different browser I have installed as backup instead of my normal one, welcoming me with first run antics. But we managed to get through it, and we got some good feedback.

The next day, off to Estonia, me and Matthijs spend the remainder of the travel day walking around Tallinn, It's quite a beautiful city and after enjoying a little to much of the local cuisine and beer got ready for the next day. I had slept terrible, woke up at 03:30 and my brain turned on and I could not turn it back off again. Great start of the day, We attended a few sessions during the day, but I noticed that I was registering less and less of what was being discussed. I felt myself slipping in to panic more and more. There I noticed another strange behavior of my body, I began to uncontrollably shake, like I was standing outside in the cold without a coat. It was not cold in the room, no one else was shivering, it took me a while but Matthijs asking me if I was ok made me realize that I was just flat out terrified. I have never experienced such fear before. Looking back at it now, I see it as a valuable experience, but at that time it just contributed to the stress. But when it was finally time to present, I somehow managed to trigger a coping mechanism I use often, put the feeling in a "box" and put that on a shelf. It doesn't exist and is not there. When my part of the presentation started, I just started talking, Matthijs commented afterwards that I started out holding the lectern, and once I let that go he noticed me shifting into the explain to peers mode, and the rest of the presentation went quite smooth. Funny thing is that I remember that moment, thinking to myself why are you holding on to this thing and letting go. But I don't remember the feeling of fear leaving along with the letting go. So in my head I was still screaming in terror, but outwards people where not noticing this. In the end I was quite happy with the result, no technical issues, no tongue twisting, no freezing up. And when we where done people approached us with questions and comments, and I had a blast talking about the subject with the attendees after the session.

At the speaker dinner that evening the conference organizer even approached us that several people had approached here complementing our session, and the feedback form some of the attendees filled in was quite positive. While I still find it hard to enjoy the result, I do feel a sense of accomplishment. I did something my 12 year old self would not even conceive of doing, and I didn't mess it up.

## Why did I want to do this? @@ dit eerst of juist hier. Not sure...

When I started school, All I knew was that I wanted to do something with computers, as time passed I learned just how vast the field of Information Technology is and the more I explored, the more the Development side of things appealed to me. One where I could just lose myself in my computer. This appealed to me given my difficult childhood, a computer is a lot more predictable than a human. As I navigated my career challenging myself to learn new things, I discovered that to solve the challenging problems and to make the most impact, the emphasis of building solutions shifted from technical excellence to communication. Having seen the impact a good team can have, and the impact of a team lead or development manager on groups of developers, I started to see the importance of communication. I started to see the importance of sharing knowledge, and the importance of being able to tell a story. I started to see the importance of being able to inspire people. It shaped my opinion about what makes a good leader and what hinders. And I came to the conclusion that the ability to communicate is the most important skill a developer can have.

I'm sure there are many paths to develop one's communication skills, but for me, I became very good at hiding behind people when it came to communicating and advocating the direction the teams I was in where going. I came to the conclusion that having a strong technological foundation is not enough. If I want to achieve great things, I need to be able to communicate my ideas and inspire others to follow me. And working on a Product in a Development team allowed me to hide to much in my technical comfort zone. So I chose to pursue a career in consulting, where, in my interpretation of the role, I would be required to communicate more. Refine my blunt communication skills to an audience that didn't implicitly trust my good intensions.

Given my dyslexia, I have always been more attracted to video and audio content primary and written content secondary. I would use conference talks and podcasts as guides to the latest and greatest in the field. I would use them to filter the firehose of new stuff. And when finding an awesome speaker I would feel an itch to be able to do that. To be able to translate a complex concept into something that can help people like me to not miss out. From the boy that was afraid to speak up and get bullied again, to someone that stands up and tells...

## Takeaways

- The importance of communication
The entire process could have been a lot smoother, and maybe a little less stressful if me and my colleague had just sat down earlier and discussed what we wanted to do, adding to that some type of sync meeting to keep track of progress. I'm quite happy with the result we achieved. But we could have lifted the presentation to a higher level if we had done so. The presentation we delivered was basically two parts glued together, where first I was waiting for him to do his part and then him waiting for me to do mine, a bit disjointed. Given some effort we could have made it more intertwined.
- Your slides matter
As I have always avoided public speaking, I never really put much effort into understanding and learning PowerPoint. Working together with a colleague that has a lot of experience with it, I learned that the slides are a big part of the story you are telling. They can help you to remember what you wanted to say, and they can help the audience to understand what you are saying. I saw my slides be transformed by him, and only in like a couple of minutes. But the impact was huge.
- Support
I could not have done this without the support of my colleague, he convinced me to do it, he basically did all the work, and allowed me to focus on what I felt I could contribute. If you, like me, have a desire to do something like this, I can't stress enough how important it is to find someone that can help and mentor you. I'm very grateful for his help.
- Practice
Once you have an idea of what you want to say, practice it. I found it very hard to talk to myself, and that didn't really get any better during the process. But I did notice that the more I practiced, the more comfortable I became with the content. And the more comfortable I became with the content, the more comfortable I became with the idea of presenting it. I also noticed that the more I practiced, the more I started to remember what I wanted to say, and the less I had to rely on the slides to remember what I wanted to say. This, at least subconsciously, enabled me to get on stage and just start talking, knowing that I would remember what I wanted to say.
