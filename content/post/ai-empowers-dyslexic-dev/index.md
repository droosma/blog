## The Struggle of a Dyslexic Developer

As a dyslexic developer, the idea of documenting projects has always been an uphill battle for me. With every piece of code I wrote, the inevitable "documentation dread" loomed over me like a dark cloud. I constantly sought refuge in strategies such as "self-documenting code" and "living documentation", always finding ways to circumnavigate the documentation storm.

However, the winds of my career aspirations finally pushed me to a point where escaping from this dreaded task was no longer an option.

## The Daunting Assignment

Recently, I embarked on a short-term assignment that involved creating an extensive architecture document. The prospect was daunting, and I questioned the necessity of such a document. After a bout of deliberation, I ended up with a list of Architecture Decision Records (ADR), which encapsulated the individual, requirement-specific architectural choices that needed to be made.

Writing about these 10 ADRs seemed as insurmountable as climbing Mount Everest. Despite having successfully captured the requirements with my colleagues and having a clear insight into the individual decisions involved, the sheer size of the task felt overwhelming.

## AI to the Rescue

Being an avid proponent of GPT in my development work, I started utilizing it to overcome my literary challenges. I began by creating a prompt with the ADR template, then moved on to describe the decision as I understood it. I wrote a large, unstructured blob of text where I attempted to explain the decision along with any requirements or unique observations from our refinement sessions.

Suddenly, one by one, like pearls on a string, the ADRs started flowing out of the GPT model. Fully filled-out templates were generated within minutes.

## Transforming Mountains into Hills

This little tool, for which I pay 20 euros a month, helped me transform the towering mountain in my head into a collection of manageable hills. Instead of staring at a blank page and having to conjure up what to write, I now had the task of reading these generated ADRs and modifying them to fit what I deemed necessary or missing. It doesnâ€™t mean that my work was done, but it did mean I had a solid launching pad.

## Looking to the Future

The saying, "AI is not going to replace you, but someone using AI will," echoes in my mind. As of now, I'm not convinced it will replace me. However, given the exponential growth of technology, who knows what tomorrow may bring? This expression rings true as an absolute minimum. It allowed someone like me, inexperienced with documentation due to my disability, to take a significant step forward.

What this journey taught me is that the future is not about man versus machine, but rather, man with machine, each aiding the other in overcoming their limitations and achieving their full potential.
