## The Struggle of a Dyslexic Developer

As a dyslexic developer, documenting projects has always felt like trying to solve an intricate puzzle with missing pieces. Every new line of code I wrote came bundled with the lingering shadow of 'documentation dread'. I frequently leaned on excuses such as 'it's self-documenting code' and techniques like 'living documentation', consistently searching for creative detours around the documentation challenge.

But, as my career aspirations grew, I found myself at a juncture where avoiding this formidable task was no longer viable.

## The Daunting Assignment

Recently, I tackled a short-term assignment that initially required the creation of a voluminous architecture document. Firm in my conviction that such grand documents are often more of a time sink than a useful tool—perhaps due to my personal aversion to both writing and reading them—I managed to persuade the team to reconsider this approach. Instead, we agreed on compiling a list of [Architecture Decision Records (ADR)](https://adr.github.io/), focusing on the individual, requirement-specific architectural choices that had to be made.

Yet, even with this compromise, the idea of detailing these 10 ADRs felt as daunting as an ascent up Mount Everest. Even though we had successfully captured the requirements and I had a clear grasp of the decisions involved, the sheer scale of the undertaking was overwhelming.

## AI to the Rescue

Being a firm advocate for GPT in my development work, I realized its potential to help me overcome my literacy challenges. It all began with creating a prompt, embedded with our chosen ADR template. To this prompt, I added some clear directions like use American English and yield responses in raw markdown format.

With the initial setup complete, the next hurdle was describing the decision as I understood it. Rather than meticulously crafting a well-structured and cohesive narrative, I let my thoughts pour out onto the page. I tried to encapsulate the decision, including all the requirements and unique insights gathered during our refinement sessions. Every consideration, every detail discussed in our meetings, was thrown into this expansive, unstructured text. I paid no heed to crafting perfect sentences or structuring my thoughts – my focus was solely on capturing everything.

Once I unleashed my stream of thoughts onto the prompt, a striking transformation occurred. Individual ADRs began materializing from the GPT model, each one taking form within a span of 10 to 20 minutes. The model functioned like a well-calibrated machine, rapidly turning raw input into neatly formatted templates. What was once a daunting task now seemed like a smoothly flowing assembly line of ideas.

## Transforming Mountains into Hills

This little tool, for which I pay 20 euros a month, helped me transform the towering mountain in my head into a collection of manageable hills. Instead of staring at a blank page and having to conjure up what to write, I now had the task of reading these generated ADRs and modifying them to fit what I deemed necessary or missing. It doesn’t mean that my work was done, but it did mean I had a solid launching pad.

## Looking to the Future

The saying, "AI is not going to replace you, but someone using AI will," echoes in my mind. As of now, I'm not convinced it will replace me. However, given the exponential growth of technology, who knows what tomorrow may bring? This expression rings true as an absolute minimum. It allowed someone like me, inexperienced with documentation due to my disability, to take a significant step forward.

What this journey taught me is that the future is not about man versus machine, but rather, man with machine, each aiding the other in overcoming their limitations and achieving their full potential.
