I'm dyslexic developer, because of this I have always disliked documenting my project. I have always looke for ways to not have to do it, "self documenting code", "living documentation" Given my career goals I have reached a point that I can no longer escape it. Recently I started a short term assignment in which I needed to create a giand architecture document. I had already challenged them on the usefullness of that, and ended up with a List of ADR (Architecture desicion records) for individual requirement specific architectural choises that needed to be made. This task, write about 10 ADR's seemed insurmountable to me. Me and some collegues already successfully managed to capture there requirements and I had a good insight into what these indivudual desciions enthailed. Felt dounthing to me.
As I have been a big proponent of using GPT in my Development work. I have started using it more and more to help me grow past my literatur challange and inexperience. So I started by creating a prompt where I added the ADR template. Next I just described the Descision as I understood it, just a big blob of text in which I tried to explain the descison along with any requirements or individual things I notices during the refinement sessions we had had.
One after another the ADR's started to flow out of the GPT model. Complete filled-out templates generated in minutes.
This small tool for which I pay 20 euro's a month just helpt me reduce the giant mountain in my head to a collection of hills. Because it generated the 10 ADRs Instead of me having the think of what to write I now have to read these, and start changing what I don't like or feel like I'm missing. This doesnt mean I'm done, but it does mean I have a good starting point.

To me the expression, "ai is not going to replace you someone using ai will" echo's in the back of my mind. I'm not sure it's not going to replace me as it stands now, NO, but technology developers exponentially so, maybe tomorrow. To me this expression is pure truth as the minimum. It allowed some one like me, inexperienced with documenting because of my disability, to take a step.
