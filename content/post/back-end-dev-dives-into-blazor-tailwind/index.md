It's been a long-standing joke among my colleagues that the front-end and I aren't exactly on friendly terms. So, when the task fell to me to build a proof of concept (PoC) addressing a front-end-centric issue for a client, there was no shortage of chuckles around the office. With no specific technologies mandated, I aimed to minimize potential pitfalls and opted for the only front-end framework I've ever had a soft spot for: [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor). It was a stroke of luck that other teams were also using Blazor.

The PoC required a theme-able [Single Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPA). Among the frameworks offering this capability, I stumbled upon TailwindCSSâ€”the latest talk of the town in the front-end world. With a smirk, I thought, "Why not play the part of a true front-end developer?" and took the plunge into this trendy framework. Now, for those wondering if my choice was solely based on its rising popularity, rest assured it wasn't. TailwindCSS genuinely seemed suited for the challenge at hand. But let's be honest, I never pass up a chance to poke fun at both myself and the quirks of the front-end community. ðŸ˜Ž

## Conclusion

The last time I dabbled in front-end development was back in 2014. I fondly recall the joy I found working with [KnockoutJS](https://knockoutjs.com/). It made me ponder: why had I grown to harbor such a disdain for front-end development? Then it hit me: a challenging project with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), fraught with the need for pixel-perfect styling. I distinctly remember vowing never to tread the front-end path again. Little did I realize that in my eagerness to escape those challenges, I was bypassing a plethora of rewarding experiences.

As I delved into my recent assignment, it dawned on me that much of what I relished in back-end work was also present in Blazor. During this project, a particular scenario required us to style a component in a specific manner. The process of achieving that look was a revelation: it wasn't front-end development I loathed, it was the intricate art of styling. Who knows, a few years down the line, I might revisit this piece and chuckle at my past self for believing I didn't detest front-end work. But for now, I revel in the clarity: it's not the entirety of front-end development that irks me, it's just the styling aspect. So, don't be taken aback if you find me delving deeper into front-end topics in my future writings.
